# A command line podcast player for linux
1. Manages your podcast information with www.buzzradio.xyz
2. Plays audio with music player deamon (Can I play audio files with ruby instead?)

# Working on
1. Fetching data from buzz.
2. Modeling data.
3. Playing episodes.
4. Updating episode state on buzz.
5. Modifying the queue.

# Fetching data from buzz
1. Logging in

  Handled in `Hive::Buzz#request` by adding user_id_hash url parameter. The
  requires the user to export the environment variable `BUZZ_USER_ID`.

2. Requesting data

  There is a thin wrapper around json requests that stores json responses
  as id indexed models. There's no error handleing here.
  This is in `Hive::Buzz.store` and `Hive::Model`

# Modeling data.
1. Basic models

  Indexed by model name and id in `Hive::STORE`

2. Extracts relationships (mapping of episode_id to an episode model), and
   fields into methods.

3. TODO: fetches missing data. If an episode belongs to a podcast that isn't
   in the store it won't be fetched (but it easy to implement)

# Playing Episodes
0. Find something other than mpd to play episodes

  I already have MPD configured on my desktop but others may not. Mpd is
  good because it provedes an evented interface through `ruby-mpd` but
  it seems to require that files are added to it's database before they
  can be played making streaming impossible and data management a little harder.

  However I'll start implementing this with MPD as a target and change it later.

1. File management

  MPD requires that files are in it's database to play them so we need to
  download episodes and update the database, then delete them later.

2. Playlist management

  What should happen to the current MPD playlist when Hive starts?

3. Queueing episodes as they are downloaded, keeping queue order consistent

# Updating episode state in buzz

1. Listening to progress events from the audio player

  Finsished, time change, (track removal?)

# Modifying the queue

1. Getting suggestions

2. Changing queue order

3. Automatically adding episodes from suggestions.
